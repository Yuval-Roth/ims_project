# Software Quality Engineering - System Testing
This is a repository for the system-testing assignment of the Software Quality Engineering course at the [Ben-Gurion University](https://in.bgu.ac.il/), Israel.

## Assignment Description
In this assignment, we tested an open-source software called Moodle (https://download.moodle.org/windows/).

$$*TODO* Add some general description about the software$$

## What we tested

We tested the submission module, created and fine-tuned by a teacher to allow a student to submit files, 
restrained by condition defined by the teacher such as the number and type of files,
the window in which file submission is allowed, etc.

*User story:* A teacher opens an assignment with a file submission limit of two, 
a student attempts to submit two files, before they save the teacher changes the file submission limit to one.

*Preconditions:* There is a course with a teacher and an open assignment, and at least one student enrolled in it.

*Expected outcome:* The student receives an error message, and is request to attempt submission again, or remove a file


*User story:* A teacher opens an assignment with a file submission limit of two,

*Preconditions:* There is a course with a teacher and an open assignment, and at least one student enrolled in it.

*Expected outcome:* The student is notified that his submission is not longer valid, and is requested to amend it.

## How we tested
We used two different testing methods:
1. [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), a behavior-driven testing framework.
2. [Provengo](https://provengo.tech/), a story-based testing framework.

Each of the testing methods is elaborated in its own directory. 

## Results
Update all README.md files (except for d-e, see Section 1). Specifically, replace all $$*TODO*â€¦$$ according to the instructions inside the $$.
