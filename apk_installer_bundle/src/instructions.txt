[before you start]
In the developer options menu:
1) Enable 'ADB Debugging'
2) Enable 'Wireless debugging'

If your device is already paired, you can skip the pairing step.

[pairing step]
In the wireless debugging menu, click on pair new device
It will say "Pair with device" at the top and you will see
an IP address that is something like xyz.xyz.xyz.xyz:ddddd

>  'xyz.xyz.xyz.xyz' is the device host address
>  'ddddd' is the pairing port

after inserting the required information and pairing successfully
you are required to find the debug port.

[connection step]
In the wireless debugging menu it will show you an ip address
with a port **different** to the one you used to pair - that is the debug port

If the device is already paired you will be prompted to insert the host address too.

after entering the required information, the apk should install successfully
